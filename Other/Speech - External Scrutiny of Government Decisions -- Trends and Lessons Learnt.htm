<UL>
  <UL><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>I had …come to an entirely 
    erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is 
    to reason from insufficient data.</FONT></I><I><SUP><FONT

<DIV align=right><B><FONT face="Times New Roman">Arthur Conan Doyle, 
1892</FONT></B></DIV><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Decision-making is 
central to human activity. That is, basically we are all decision makers. On a 
daily basis managers tend to make many decisions. Some decisions are routine 
while others may have a significant impact on the operations of the 
organization. A good decision is unlikely to arise by accident, tossing a coin, 
asking an oracle or using an astrologer. Nevertheless, it may often ultimately 
depend on the judgement of the decision-maker. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>Critical decisions, ideally, should not be wrong 
or have an adverse impact into the future. An example from the defence arena is 
‘force structure’ decisions where sub-optimal decisions will not only place the 
defence of the nation at risk but are almost impossible to correct or overcome 
in the short to medium term. In our increasingly complex environment, the task 
of decision-makers is becoming more challenging with managers needing to respond 
quickly to events that seem to take place at an ever-increasing pace with a 
bewildering array of choices and consequences to consider.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>The process of managerial decision-making is 
synonymous with the practice of management, that is, decision-making is at the 
core of all managerial functions. The complexity of today’s environment has 
meant that it is no longer possible for one individual to be aware of all the 
issues nor to make all decisions regarding an organisation’s operation – even 
with a relatively small span of control. The factors affecting decisions are 
often so numerous and their effects so pervasive that ‘seat of the pants’ 
decisions are no longer acceptable. Effective decision-making requires the 
availability of information, analysed and summarised in a timely fashion. We are 
now often required not only to defend our decisions, but also the basis on which 
they are made.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Following this 
theme, my colleague, Ron Richards, drew my attention to Paul Barry’s book 
</FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>‘Rich Kids’</FONT></I><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4> which provides an insight into some of the 
excesses of decision-making at the ‘big end of town’, as the following 
illustrates:</FONT><BR>
<UL>
  <UL><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Despite the chaos, Jodee was not 
    prepared to wait. His attitude had always been to get customers first and 
    fix problems later….One senior manager described it as a suicidal decision, 
    and says it [the launch of Next Gen] should have been delayed six months. 
    But Jodee is adamant that he made the right decision, and does not recall 
    anyone advising him against it….One.Tel had always been a thinly disguised 
    autocracy in which Jodee made all the key decisions, and it was getting more 
    like that as time went on .</FONT></I><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman"

<DIV align=right><B><FONT face="Times New Roman">Paul Barry, 
2002</FONT></B></DIV><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Turning to my task 
for today, I have been asked to give a watchdog’s perspective on government 
decision-making. Although Lord Justice Lopes referred to auditors as 
</FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>‘a watchdog and not a blood 
hound’</FONT></I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4> the former is not a term I 
particularly like. However, staying with the term, this particular watchdog 
relies significantly on the power of public disclosure. The ANAO operates mainly 
in the context of public opinion of which Parliament is arguably the most 
influential and the most vocal. Our central function is to report, that is, to 
make people aware of what is happening. Like a watchdog, it is our bark that 
alerts others to the existence of something wrong in public administration. 
However, I would also add that, for the most part, we provide assurance that all 
is well. To undertake this role, the independence of my Office is essential and 
critical. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>In the public 
sector, external independent audit is a critical element in the accountability 
chain and the importance of the independence of my Office in that respect cannot 
be overstated. It is vital that Auditors-General have all the professional and 
functional freedom required to fulfil fearlessly, professionally and 
independently, the role required of them. This is particularly so in today’s 
climate with the convergence of the public and private sectors, the management 
environment becoming inherently less open and riskier, and with the heightened 
concerns for public accountability. The latter reflects Senate action on 
commercial-in-confidence considerations in contracts</FONT><SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>3</FONT></SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman"> 
</FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>and the Joint Committee of Public 
Accounts and Audit’s (JCPAA’s) support for audit access to private sector 
information and premises, where warranted.</FONT><SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>4</FONT></SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman"> 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Following the fallout from 
the HIH, Enron and other large corporate failures, the private-sector auditor 
independence debate still has a way to go in Australia with the recently 
released Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) survey results 
from 100 of Australia’s largest companies and the Government’s formal response 
to the Ramsay Report being keenly awaited.</FONT><SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman">5</FONT></SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman"> </FONT><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>For example, the ASIC survey noted that most 
companies lacked robust processes for ensuring that independence of audit was 
not prejudiced by the provision of non-audit services.</FONT><SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman">6</FONT></SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman"> 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>The United States (US) 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recognised the need to modernise 
the rules for determining whether an auditor is independent, as the following 
illustrates: </FONT><BR>
<UL>
  <UL><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Yet increased economic pressure 
    on the profession, coupled with greater competition and consolidation, 
    mandated that we bring clarity and light to the necessarily subjective 
    nature of independence.</FONT></I><I><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
    size=4>7</FONT></SUP></I><FONT face="Times New Roman"> 
</FONT><BR></UL></UL><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>In February 2001, the 
SEC released a final ruling on the requirements for auditor independence that 
sets out restrictions on financial, employment and business relationships 
between an accountant and an audit client and restrictions on an accountant 
providing certain non-audit services to an audit client. My counterpart in the 
US, the Comptroller General and head of the General Accounting Office (GAO), 
recently announced (25 January 2002) significant changes to the auditor 
independence requirements under Government Accounting Standards</FONT><SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman">8</FONT></SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>. The 
new standards deal with a range of auditor independence issues with the most 
significant changes relating to the rules associated with non-audit, or 
consulting services. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Before 
leaving the independence theme, I will briefly canvass my role in providing 
independent assurance to Parliament on the </FONT><U><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>overall</FONT></U><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4> performance and accountability of the public sector in delivering the 
Government’s programs and services and implementing effectively a wide range of 
public sector reforms.</FONT><BR><BR><BR><B><FONT face="Times New Roman"

Implementation</FONT></B><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Performance 
audits are the main vehicle by which my Office evaluates the economy, efficiency 
and effectiveness of the management of public sector entities. This entails: the 
examination and assessment of resource use; related information systems; outputs 
and outcomes, including performance targets, indicators, assessments and 
measures; monitoring systems; and legal compliance. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT

    principles which underpin public audit:</FONT></I><BR></UL></UL><FONT

</FONT></I><FONT face="Times New Roman"></FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>The ANAO’s performance audits can, and do, 
evaluate how effectively and efficiently government policy has been implemented. 
Sometimes there can be a perception of an audit commenting on policy, 
particularly where the implementation performance reflects a problem with the 
policy itself rather than with its delivery. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>One particular challenge in the current 
environment of change is the increasing tension regarding the role of 
Auditors-General and the boundaries between government policy and its 
implementation. The issue was given some prominence in the following two 
performance audits my Office undertook recently - property sales and IT 
Outsourcing.</FONT><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>10</FONT></SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman"> </FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>The nub of 
the issue is summed up by Professor Richard Mulgan:</FONT><BR>
<UL>
  <UL><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>The principles of performance 
    auditing allow the Auditor-General to assess whether government policy has 
    been efficiently and effectively implemented but they require him to take 
    government policy as given. Had the Auditor General crossed the line [in 
    these two audits] which bars him from questioning government policy? 
    Certainly the Opposition treated the report as providing ammunition not only 
    against [the Department of] Finance but also against the Minister and 
    government policy. On the other hand, the Auditor General was clearly aware 
    of the potential difficulty and his report takes care to confine the audit 
    to claim that his audit was confined to implementation and administration. 
    Criticism is aimed exclusively at Finance and the substance of its advice to 
    government…</FONT></I><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
    size=4>and</FONT><BR><BR><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>On the 
    whole, public opinion, as expressed in media comment, seems to side with the 
    Auditor-General. He was exercising his time-honoured role as investigator of 
    government inefficiency and guardian of the public purse. Pointing out that 
    public funds would be wasted by a particular method chosen for selling 
    governments properties could hardly be beyond the purview of the public’s 
    financial watchdog.</FONT></I><SUP><FONT 
    face="Times New Roman">11</FONT></SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman"> 
  </FONT></UL></UL><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>I responded to 
Professor Mulgan’s article, making the point that:</FONT><BR>
<UL>
  <UL><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Policy advising is an output of 
    Finance and it is clearly within the mandate of the Auditor-General to 
    review how effectively the department delivered its output. That the 
    government subsequently may have endorsed a policy based on such advice does 
    not take away from the mandate of the Auditor-General to review the 
    department’s development of the advice nor its possible 
    implications.</FONT></I><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
    size=4>12</FONT></SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
    face="Times New Roman"></FONT><BR></UL></UL><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>Clearly, it is politicians not public servants who take responsibility 
for policy and it is for this reason that performance audits are restricted to 
the efficiency, effectiveness and propriety with which policy is implemented. As 
I noted earlier, they are not extended to cover the merits of the policy itself. 
However, problems can arise where policy is difficult to separate from 
implementation, for example as in the subject matter of the above comments: 
</FONT><BR>
<UL>
  <UL><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>What was the policy in this case 
    [that is, property sales] ? To maximise long-term benefit to the 
    Commonwealth by selling buildings only where it is profitable to do so? In 
    this case, the Auditor General, had every right to indicate where financial 
    losses were likely. Such losses would indicate that the policy was badly 
    implemented. Alternatively, the policy may have been to divest the 
    government of a large number of buildings within a stated time, even if the 
    long-term effects on the Commonwealth were doubtful…In this case, the 
    Auditor-General could be seen to be on more dangerous grounds in questioning 
    the criteria for putting buildings on the market or suggesting that 
    prospective sales should have been reconsidered if the price was 
    inadequate.</FONT></I><I><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
    size=4>13</FONT></SUP></I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
    face="Times New Roman"></FONT></UL></UL><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>One ‘positive’ to come out of this tension is the recognition that 
government policy objectives need to be stated in less ambiguous terms with the 
lines between policy and implementation made reasonably clear. </FONT><BR>
<UL>
  <UL><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Performance audit assumes a clear 
    distinction between policy objectives (set by elected governments) and 
    policy implementation (carried out by servants or contractors). Auditors are 
    assumed to leave the objectives to government and confine themselves to the 
    efficiency, effectiveness and probity with which these objectives have been 
    implemented.</FONT></I><I><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
    size=4>14</FONT></SUP></I><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4> 
    </FONT></I><FONT face="Times New Roman"></FONT><BR></UL></UL><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>That said, the performance audit mandate has 
become an essential element in the accountability process of any public 
jurisdiction, especially the new public management environment. It is not a 
static process and there will be a continuing emphasis on improving the service 
to Parliament. Conflict and controversy may be inevitable. However, as one 
senior Australian bureaucrat remarked:</FONT><BR>
<UL>
  <UL><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>The bulk of performance audits 
    are good at working out what is happening in a field, giving a useful report 
    on it and striking an appropriate balance in not dabbling in policy and 
    seriously discussing how implementation is going.</FONT></I><I><SUP><FONT 
    face="Times New Roman" size=4>15</FONT></SUP></I><I><FONT 
    face="Times New Roman" size=4> </FONT></I><FONT 
    face="Times New Roman"></FONT></UL></UL><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>With that observation, I will now move on to the decision-making trends 
and issues that the ANAO has highlighted during our performance audits over the 
last few years. I will then follow this up with a short discussion on some of 
the particular matters arising from these audits, that is, risk management, 
records management, ethics, privacy, and IT support systems. All these aspects 
bear directly on organisational decision-making and its external scrutiny. They 
reflect the wide-ranging nature of, and need for checks and balances in, the 
public sector environment.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=5>III. An Overview of Recent Performance Audits</FONT></B><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>Performance audits generally reflect the 
complexity of administrative decision-making in the public sector. As such, 
there can be significant demands made on management which are further 
complicated by notions of cooperation, coordination and collaboration 
increasingly required by partnerships/joint activity being established across 
agencies, across levels of government and with the private sector as both 
service providers to, and for, the public sector. I was interested to read a 
recent observation by Dr Peter Shergold, Secretary of the Department of 
Education, Science and Training, that public servants should not simply see 
themselves as public administrators but as knowledge managers who:</FONT><BR>
<UL><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>turn vast amounts of information – 
  research, evaluation, experience, skill – into knowledge that can inform in a 
  robust way the deliberations of government. That requires of us not only to 
  ensure that we can inform our Ministers to the highest standards of accuracy, 
  but that we can anticipate the information that is required; that we can be 
  creative in the policy options we provide; and that we show a bias for action 
  in translating policy into well-administered programmes and 
  services</FONT></I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>.</FONT><SUP><FONT 
  face="Times New Roman" size=4>16</FONT></SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
  size=4> </FONT><BR><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4></FONT></I></UL><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>One of the more significant issues in performance 
audits in recent years has been the impact of the loss of corporate knowledge in 
public sector organisations. This has occurred mainly because of the age 
structure of public servants, downsizing or rightsizing, and the greater 
flexibility to move between the public and private sectors. Not surprisingly, 
the loss of corporate knowledge impacts markedly on administrative processes, 
understanding of the environment and the related legislation and the links to 
decisions made, including the need for credible records which are increasingly 
electronically based.</FONT> 
<UL></UL><B><U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI) Services</FONT></U></B><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>The MRI 
Audit Report</FONT><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>17</FONT></SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4> </FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>concerned the administrative processes involved in the negotiation and 
development of the MRI policy measure including allegations of improper 
behaviour. The report focussed on the processes that surrounded the decision to 
allow Medicare benefits to be paid for MRI services provided with equipment 
ordered up to the delivery of the budget speech on 12 May 1998. Accordingly, one 
of the key concerns arising in relation to this audit was whether there was a 
leak of Budget information that led to a pre-Budget rush of orders. The most 
significant interactions between the Commonwealth and the profession in 
connection with this matter occurred in the final stages of negotiations. 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>The major areas of weakness 
uncovered during the audit were:</FONT><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>18</FONT></SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
face="Times New Roman"></FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New (W" size=4>(a) Risk 
management associated with budget sensitive information.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>Risk management can no longer be seen as 
discretionary but must be an essential element of sound corporate governance and 
management practice. I will be addressing risk management more generally later 
in the paper but in this specific case, there was insufficient consideration 
given to risk identification and management for some aspects of the policy 
development process and the measure itself, particularly in regard to the 
decision to include machines ordered by Budget night. As a result, there were 
exposures on both these fronts, which could have been better managed. This is 
not just a judgement made in hindsight, but reflects the importance of risk 
identification and treatment as an integral part of management at all levels of 
an organisation. Clearly, there are challenges in managing budget sensitive 
information and its is essential that agencies develop suitable risk management 
strategies to preserve the integrity of this information to protect the 
interests of all concerned.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New (W" size=4>(b) 
Probity and confidentiality arrangements for negotiations with radiologist 
representatives.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Negotiating 
new policy measures with professional and other organisations presents 
significant challenges in managing budget sensitive matters, particularly where 
those involved may gain knowledge or insights which could benefit them 
financially. The ANAO concluded that the Department’s management of the probity 
arrangements surrounding the negotiations for the MRI measure was not adequate 
for the circumstances. The arrangements in place lacked structure and clarity. 
Specifically, the Department did not seek to agree with members of the Task 
Force what confidentiality arrangements would apply to certain information and 
procedures. </FONT>
<P><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Similarly, there were no agreed 
procedures or arrangements for declarations of any conflict of interest. As a 
result, the Department did not achieve a shared understanding of, and commitment 
to, what was to be treated in confidence and what could reasonably be discussed 
more openly. This was primarily the responsibility of the Department as part of 
its accountability for the process. Once established, all parties would then 
have been bound by the agreed arrangements.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New (W" size=4>(c) Lack of adequate 
documentation.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>A key plank in 
sound administration and accountability is the adequate recording and 
documentation of the business of government – this is another issue I will 
revisit later. In the MRI case, there was a lack of adequate documentation by 
the Department of the negotiations with the College (the Royal Australian and 
New Zealand College of Radiologists). No record was kept of meetings between the 
Department and the College and there was no record of what was agreed. The 
pressure on the department to progress sensitive consultations over a short time 
actually demand greater discipline in record keeping and accountability as part 
of sound corporate governance.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>There was also a lack of adequate documentation in relation to the 
development of some elements of the policy on MRI, specifically about the 
merits, risks and alternative options in relation to the inclusion of machines 
on order. Official records were not taken or maintained of some significant 
briefings of, and decisions by, the Minister. As a consequence, there is limited 
departmental documentation on the development of the key elements of the MRI 
supply measure. Such documentation also would have assisted in better informing 
senior departmental management of the progress with the development of the 
policy proposal in view of their functional and operational responsibilities. 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New (W" size=4>(d) The quality of the processes 
supporting advice to the Minister.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>The policy measure itself provided for benefits to be paid for MRI 
services by registered providers on eligible machines in place, or ordered, 
before Budget night. The Department’s processes for developing the proposal to 
include machines on order before Budget night in the Budget measure, and in 
providing advice to the Minister on this matter, could have usefully involved 
greater consideration and attention to </FONT><U><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>all</FONT></U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4> relevant options. As 
well, more consideration could have been given to attendant benefits and risks 
for delivering the key supply measure and to the provision of information 
relevant to the Minister’s assessment of departmental advice. This conclusion 
applies both to advice at Budget time and to subsequent advice concerning 
emerging problems with respect to machines on order. By way of illustration, in 
the weeks immediately preceding the Budget, the Department considered the most 
significant issue to be addressed in developing the policy measure was the risk 
of not achieving an agreement with the college.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT

of the Federation Fund using the better practice principles of rigor, 
transparency and equity that are applicable to the selection of projects under

(PM&amp;C) established a Federation Fund Taskforce of officials which assessed 
the majority of Federation Fund proposals that were later considered by a 
Committee of Ministers.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>The 
audit found that the initial assessment and short-listing process conducted by 
the Taskforce lacked rigor and there was an uneven treatment demonstrated by the 
absence of any clear relationship between proposals rated highly against the 
selection criteria and those listed for ‘detailed assessment’. The quality of 
the Taskforce’s detailed assessments, while more transparent, was not as 
comprehensive as it could have been because of the:</FONT><BR><BR><FONT

Tension between standards for public administration and Cabinet conventions. 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>While these transparency 
issues are more or less ‘standard fare’, I included this report in my paper 
because the Federation Fund Program is atypical in that it has elements of 
administrative decision-making by a Committee of Ministers while at the same 
time operating under normal Cabinet conventions. This report draws attention to 
the tension between the standards of documentation normally expected with 
administrative decision-making and conventions normally expected with Cabinet 
deliberations. The Prime Minister advised that, although the Federation Fund 
contained an element of administrative decision-making, the process also 
involved considerations of the national interest that Ministers are best able to 
determine. The Prime Minister also made the point that, unlike officials, 
elected governments are accountable directly for their decisions to the 
electorate.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>For the purposes 
of this audit, a distinction was made between the policy decisions of government 
and administrative judgements made by government where projects are selected on 
merit against pre-determined objectives and criteria. Given that projects were 
to be selected on their merits, a more transparent process would have assisted 
in demonstrating that the greatest benefit was being obtained for the 
expenditure of public funds in excess of $900 million, as well as providing 
greater confidence in the decision-making process. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT

Commonwealth estate property sales</FONT><SUP><FONT

referred to earlier, involved reviewing the advice provided to Ministers that 
established the property sales program and the administration of the sales 
program, including consideration of whether it was in accordance with relevant 
policies and represented value for money.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New (W" size=4>While I do not wish to track over ground covered 
earlier, there are aspects of this audit that go to the heart of my remit – that 
is, p</FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>olicy advising as an output of 
agencies and how effectively it is delivered is an issue that effects decisions 
taken by governments. In this audit the following three matters are worthy of 
discussion.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New (W" size=4>(a) The Value for 
Money Issue. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>The ANAO 
analyses of the whole-of-lease-term costs for sale and long-term leaseback of 
property found that a potential negative financial return to the Commonwealth 
within the lease period was likely. In the transactions reviewed by ANAO, it was 
not apparent that a systematic process of inquiry, as required under the 
Financial Management and Accountability Regulations and the </FONT><I><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>Commonwealth Procurement 
Guidelines</FONT></I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>, was conducted by the 
Department of Finance and Administration (Finance) prior to executing the sale 
contract and leasing arrangements with the purchasers. ANAO’s legal advice is 
that if there is a conflict between the efficient and effective use of public 
money and the requirements of the Commonwealth Property Principles (CPPs) it 
would be prudent to seek guidance or reconsideration of the policy. In 
circumstances where a proposed sale of Commonwealth property does not appear to 
represent value for money at the time of the final sale, it would be good 
administrative practice to inform Minister(s) of the inquiries undertaken and 
seek their consent before proceeding with the sale.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New (W" size=4>(b) The Hurdle Rate Issue. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>The ANAO queried the departmental advice, 
</FONT><U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>not</FONT></U><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4> the policy, concerning the hurdle rate of return 
threshold of 15%, questioning its level which, in effect, would force the sale 
of almost all Commonwealth properties that did not meet the public interest 
test. This would result in a sub-optimal investment outcome and financial loss 
to the Commonwealth when combined with long-term leaseback arrangements. Our 
analysis indicated that, in contrast to applying the hurdle rate of 
</FONT><U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>15%</FONT></U><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4> resulting in divestment of virtually all of the 
property holding, or some 99% by value ($1 038 million), the application of a 
hurdle rate of:</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Wingdings size=2>q </FONT><U><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>10%</FONT></U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4> 
- only 8 of the 59 properties would have been scheduled for divestment, with a 
book value of $232 million; or</FONT><BR><FONT face=Wingdings size=2>q 
</FONT><U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>12%</FONT></U><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4> - would have resulted in divestment of only 23 
properties, with a book value of $326 million.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>The consulting firm engaged by Finance during 2000 
suggested </FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>‘a wide range for the 
property hurdle return is appropriate, with the upper bound at approximately 
11%.’</FONT></I><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman">22</FONT></SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman"> </FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman"></FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>In practice, all properties that exceeded the 
hurdle rate were recommended for divestment, except one property in the 
Parliamentary Triangle that was retained in the public interest. The 
documentation made available to ANAO did not allow for an effective review of 
the assumptions underpinning the rates of return identified by the Commonwealth 
Property Committee (CPC) for the properties recommended for 
divestment.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>The risk 
measurement approach adopted by the consulting firm that reported to Finance in 
October 1999 and October 2000 is consistent with </FONT><U><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>project specific</FONT></U><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4> risk rates for property. This approach accords 
with that recommended by the then Department of Finance (Finance) in the 1991 
</FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Handbook of Cost-Benefit Analysis 
</FONT></I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>for the setting of discount 
rates. That publication advocated that the best option in choosing a discount 
rate is to develop a </FONT><U><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>project-specific</FONT></U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4> rate. A 
property with security of tenure to the Commonwealth in the form of a 
non-cancelable lease over a long period represents a low risk. Consequently, the 
criteria used for the hold/sell decision should reflect that risk 
profile.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New (W" size=4>(c) Confusion of Roles. 
</FONT><BR>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Finance advised ANAO in April 2001 that 
its role was to implement a property divestment program endorsed by Ministers 
and that it was not charged with the role of protecting the overall interest of 
the Commonwealth. ANAO considers that, given the administrative division of 
responsibility and accountability, Finance is the only agency in a position to 
ensure that property divestment is consistent with the CPPs and to make an 
informed judgment as to whether a property sale and leaseback transaction 
represents efficient and effective use of Commonwealth resources at the time of 
the transaction.</FONT><BR><BR><B><U><FONT face="Times New (W" size=4>GP House 
Grant</FONT></U></B><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>The recently 
tabled Report</FONT><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>23</FONT></SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>into the allocation of grant funding for the 
co-location of National General Practice organisations focussed on: whether due 
process was followed in making the decision to transfer funds between Outcomes; 
the procedures adopted by Health and Aged Care in developing the proposal; the 
advisory role played by Finance ; and specific advice provided to 
Ministers.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>(a) Lack of 
adequate documentation</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>For a 
significant period, the documentary evidence relating to the development of the 
proposal by Health and Aged Care was sketchy and this underscores the importance 
of ensuring that adequate records are maintained during the development of 
policy measures. The department is committed to bringing more discipline to 
documenting information, with a particular focus on practices around the 
creation of file notes and in formalising key advice to the Minister. This issue 
was also raised in the MRI example above. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>(b) The Adequacy of advice to 
Ministers</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>The ANAO took the 
view that there was uncertainty in the Cabinet endorsed guidelines regarding 
whether initiatives, proposed by the Minister for Health and Aged Care, should 
have been treated as a reallocation of administered expenses between outcomes or 
as a new policy measure. It is not unreasonable to come to a view that the issue 
was not clear cut. While both departments considered their actions were 
consistent with the guidelines, advice to Ministers did not address this 
particular matter specifically. An alternative view would have been that, 
because the ‘fortuitous’ nature of the savings offered as an offset and the 
effect of the entirely new initiative, it would have been prudent to treat the 
co-location proposal as a new policy measure. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>In its advice to the Minister, Health and Aged 
Care did not give consideration to whether the proposal constituted a new policy 
and therefore required additional approval. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>The Finance advice to its Minister did discuss the 
question as to whether the funding source represented ‘fortuitous’ savings, the 
proposal’s inconsistency with the Government’s rural and regional program, and 
the outcomes involved, recommending that the proposal be opposed. However, given 
its clear opposition to the proposal, the Finance advice did not address the 
process by which approval for the measure should be sought. The department did 
not normally consider that it was necessary to provide details of the process by 
which approval for the process should be sought, stating that it does not 
normally provide these details when advising against a 
proposal.</FONT><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman">24</FONT></SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman"> </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>(c) 
Clarifying budgetary guidance</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>Given the uncertainly regarding the application of budgetary guidance in 
this case, the ANAO suggested that consideration be given by Finance to 
reviewing the relevant guidance and, as necessary, providing advice to Cabinet 
to clarify current guidance. In the ANAO’s view, the areas that would benefit 
from review include: the merits of guidance in determining whether a proposal is 
consistent with previous Cabinet or Ministers’ decisions; and whether current 
guidance on the reallocation of administered expenses which involve fortuitous 
savings might desirably be strengthened. While Finance has advised that 
operational guidelines have been consolidated for the 2002-03 Budget, the ANAO 
considers that there would be merit in a further 
review.</FONT><BR><BR><B><U><FONT face="Times New (W" size=4>Commonwealth IT 
Outsourcing Initiative</FONT></U></B><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>The outsourcing of IT arose from a government decision known as the IT 
Initiative, which was to transfer around $A4 billion of IT in Federal agencies 
to the private sector. The then Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology 
Outsourcing (OASITO) managed the Initiative centrally for the government through 
a series of tenders dealing with groupings of agencies (clusters). The 
audit</FONT><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman">25</FONT></SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman"> </FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>examined the 
administrative and financial effectiveness of the implementation of the IT 
Initiative and was conducted against the background of the Prime Minister’s 
letter of December 1998, advising Portfolio Ministers that </FONT><I><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>‘as a general Government policy, outsourcing of IT 
infrastructure services should proceed unless there is a compelling business 
case on a whole-of-government basis for not doing so.’</FONT></I><SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4> </FONT></SUP><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman"

face="Times New Roman"></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New (W" size=4>(a) Agencies’ Roles under the IT 
Initiative</FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>In examining the effectiveness of these 
‘clusters’, experience suggests that, within the policy context, there were 
areas where the structure of the agency groupings could have been enhanced to 
better support agency business requirements (in terms of relative size, business 
focus, funding arrangements and security requirements). The audit report 
recommended an analysis of the existing groupings to identify opportunities to 
cost effectively optimize their composition considering the appropriateness and 
effectiveness of combining agencies of disparate size and business focus under a 
single arrangement. Additionally, as the Humphry Review noted, </FONT><I><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>‘the clustering of contracts is felt by some 
members of the industry to limit their access to the government IT 
market.’</FONT></I><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>27</FONT></SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4> </FONT><FONT 
face="Times New Roman"></FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>There 
was an uneven level of support for the way OASITO went about letting the 
tenders. Several Chief Executives had significant doubts about the ability of 
the Initiative to deliver the savings projected for it and/or to deliver the 
quality of service required. Being responsible for the results, it is not 
surprising that they wanted to assess the Initiative’s implementation carefully. 
Unfortunately, this was later perceived as an unwillingness to 
change.</FONT><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4></FONT><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>In particular, for those agencies where the IT 
requirement was predominantly scientific (for example the Bureau of Meteorology 
or the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) or 
otherwise related to the core activities of a particular agency (for example, 
the payment of pensions), the arrangement posed significant problems of 
corporate governance for them. The approach taken by OASITO was designed to 
implement the Government’s policy agenda under centralised direction (and 
control) despite the perceived reluctance (buy-in) of some of the agency heads 
because they did not have the degree of control necessary to best manage 
transition risks, and because they were ultimately responsible for the agency 
outputs and outcomes and the budgets involved.</FONT><SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>28</FONT></SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman"> 
</FONT><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4></FONT><BR><FONT 
face="Times New (W" size=4>(b) The Savings Issue</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>Preliminary studies identified significant savings 
that would accrue from implementing the Initiative. Indeed, the projected 
savings from the implementation of the IT Initiative were removed, upfront, from 
the respective agency’s forward estimates. What is significant is that the 
financial evaluation methodology applied in the tenders did not allow for two 
key factors that were material to the assessment of savings arising from 
outsourcing the services. The evaluations did not consider the service potential 
associated with agency assets expected to be on hand at the end of the 
evaluation period under the business-as-usual case, or the costs arising from 
the Commonwealth’s guarantee of the external service provider’s (ESP) asset 
values under the outsourcing case. Consequently, the financial savings realised 
by the agencies from outsourcing, as quantified in the tender evaluations, were 
overstated. This was disputed by OASITO and by the Minister 
concerned.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>The central issue 
turned on interpretation of the accounting standard dealing with financial and 
operational leases. The different interpretations extended into the private 
sector that were later reviewed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and 
Audit (JCPAA). The JCPAA concluded that the correct treatment of accounting 
standards is fundamental to transparent reporting and budget honesty. Agencies 
should adopt consistent accounting standards which are also consistent with the 
proper management of risk to the Commonwealth.</FONT><SUP><FONT

</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New (W" size=4>(d) Management 
Issues</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>The ANAO identified a 
range of issues on which agencies should place particular focus in the 
management of IT outsourcing arrangements as follows:</FONT><BR><BR><FONT

size=4>identification and management of ‘whole of contract’ issues including the 
retention of corporate knowledge, succession planning, and industrial relations

service levels and other deliverables in the agreement so as to focus 
unambiguously on the management effort of both the ESP and agencies on the 
aspects of service delivery most relevant to agencies’ business requirements; 
and</FONT><BR><FONT face=Wingdings size=2>q </FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>the ESP’s appreciation of, and ability to provide, the performance and

<UL></UL><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>As a response to the audit, the 
Government commissioned a review of IT outsourcing conducted by Richard Humphry 
AO (Managing Director, Australian Stock Exchange). This independent review 
recognised the implicit management dilemma described above and recommended that, 
because Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of agencies had the statutory 
responsibility, they should be responsible for the outsourcing decisions. In 
particular, decisions that impacted upon the core business of the agency needed 
to be taken at agency level. Mr Humphry remarked:</FONT><BR>

size=4>32</FONT></SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman"> </FONT><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>This included that the responsibility for 
implementation of the IT Initiative be devolved to Commonwealth agencies in 
accordance with the culture of performance and accountability incorporated in 
the relevant financial management legislation. Agencies are required to obtain 
value for money (including savings) and maximise Australian industry development 
outcomes. Agency heads will be held directly accountable for achieving these 
objectives within a reasonable timeframe, as well as grouping with other 
agencies at their discretion, wherever possible, to establish the economies of 
scale required to maximise outcomes.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"

separate body has been established within the Department of Finance and 
Administration to advise agencies, at </FONT><U><FONT face="Times New Roman"

for service basis, on managing their transition. Audit experience indicates that 
the agency emphasis has to be on developing a robust analysis of business 
requirements at the initial stage, which would be the basis of a strong business 
case for whatever IT strategy is developed. Without OASITO’s involvement, the 
industry can now deal directly, </FONT><U><FONT face="Times New Roman"

people responsible for the function and related outputs and outcomes, as well as 
with those who will be managing the contract. The inability to have this

arrangements managed by OASITO. This is a significant lesson for all future 
outsourcing arrangements. </FONT><BR><BR><B><U><FONT face="Times New (W"

face="Times New Roman" size=4>The ANAO has continued to foster the view that 
risk management is an essential element of corporate governance underlying many 
of the reforms that are currently taking place in the public sector. To restate 
my point, it is not a separate activity within management but an integral part 
of good management process, particularly as an adjunct to the control 
environment, when we have limited resources and competing priorities. Against 
the background of the increasing use of a range of different service delivery 
arrangements; greater involvement of the private sector in the provision of 
public services; and with a more contestable/competitive market-oriented 
imperative risk management can only become more critical. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT

to ensuring that the best decision is made. This will require placing emphasis 
on making the ‘right rather than quick decisions’. That said, with the increased 
convergence between the public and private sectors, there will be a need to 
consider a private sector point of view where the focus on cost, quality and

consequently the standard of record-keeping has been a recurring issue in ANAO

</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Records are consulted as

anyone inquiring into a decision, a process or the performance of an 
organisation or an individual. As such, they are an appropriate example of not 
only the importance of good process, but also how it often contributes 
importantly to the myriad of public sector outcomes or results. With the move to 
greater outsourcing to the private sector, there is increasing concern about 
organisations’ ability to preserve those records that are needed to support the 
delivery of programs and services, and to meet their accountability, as well as 
archival, obligations. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>Following the Australian Law Reform Commission’s 1998 report on the 
Archives Act</FONT><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman">51</FONT></SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>, the National Archives has been increasingly 
pro-active in the promulgation of guidance to Commonwealth bodies on 
record-keeping practices. Commonwealth record-keeping guidance culminated with 
release in March 2000 of an extensive range of record-keeping standards, 
policies, tools and guidelines for the Commonwealth on the National Archives 
web-site under its </FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman"

</FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>e-permanence</FONT></I><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4> guidelines form the basis for a coherent 
framework for Commonwealth record-keeping. Some of the guidelines are formal 
requirements, for example, where they are linked to Government record-keeping 
requirements for web-based activity under the </FONT><I><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>Government On-Line</FONT></I><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4> strategy.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>Higher standards of accountability are expected in 
the public sector than is usual in the private sector and recognising this, 
Parliament has passed legislation relevant to record-keeping that applies to all 
Commonwealth agencies, such as the </FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>Archives Act 1983</FONT></I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>, the 
</FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Freedom of Information (FOI) Act

face="Times New Roman" size=4>Privacy Act 1988</FONT></I><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>. These Acts deal with the overarching issues of 
maintenance, archiving and destruction of records, access to records by the 
public, and confidentiality of records. Also of relevance, particularly from a 
management viewpoint, are the </FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>Public Service Act 1999</FONT></I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>, 
the </FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Financial Management and 
Accountability (FMA) Act 1997</FONT></I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4> and 
the </FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Commonwealth Authorities and 
Companies (CAC) Act 1997.</FONT></I><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>The FMA Act requires that Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) manage the 
affairs of their agencies in a way that promotes proper use (that is, efficient, 
effective and ethical use) of the Commonwealth resources for which the Chief 
Executive or Board is responsible. A CEO must ensure that the accounts and 
records of the agency are kept as required by the Finance Minister’s Orders. 
Record-keeping is also covered by the CAC Act, which requires a Commonwealth 
authority to keep accounting records that properly record and explain its 
transactions and financial position. These records have to be kept in a way that 
enables the preparation of financial statements and that allows those statements 
to be audited appropriately and effectively.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>In addition to legislative requirements, there are 
several other significant reasons for emphasising the importance of 
record-keeping in the public sector. Up-to-date, accessible, relevant and 
accurate records can ensure that decisions made by an agency are consistent, 
based on accurate information; are cost-effective; engender a sense of ownership 
of decisions throughout the agency; and place the agency in a considerably 
better position to justify to Parliament and the public any decisions made. I 
stress that it is often not just outputs and outcomes that are of concern to 
Parliament and the public, but also the </FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>processes</FONT></I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4> of 
decision-making and the </FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>reasons 
</FONT></I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>for decisions made. Such 
transparency is achieved by ensuring that the decision-making process, and the 
reasons for decisions made, are adequately documented by the 
agency.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Transparency, through 
record-keeping, is an agency’s first line of defence against accusations of 
bias, unfair treatment and other negative public perceptions. It also promotes 
confidence in the integrity of the Australian Public Service (APS) and provides 
assurance to stakeholders that the APS is making decisions in the ‘public 
interest’, particularly where procurement is concerned, as well as meeting any 
requirements for fairness, equity, privacy and freedom of information. 
Transparency also provides some guarantee of integrity of information, which 
improves the scope for governments to make constructive use of the internet in 
dealing with their citizens.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>Countering the loss of corporate knowledge is another area that can be 
greatly assisted by a sound record-keeping culture. Corporate knowledge is 
largely the wealth of information and experience that is stored on paper, 
electronically or mentally. Of course, we are well aware that such knowledge is 
only useful when something is actually done with it. Loss of corporate knowledge 
has been a significant issue for the public sector in recent years where, due to 
the trend towards high turnover and increasing mobility of staff, in part the 
result of outsourcing activity and privatisation of public sector organisations 
and activities, we have seen an enormous drain on the retained knowledge of the 
APS through the departure of many experienced individuals. The creation and 
maintenance of suitable records can alleviate this problem to some extent, 
particularly in relation to decision-making. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>The fact that formal systems cannot easily store 
or transfer ‘tacit’ knowledge is acknowledged</FONT><SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman">52</FONT></SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>. 
Nevertheless, a relatively inexperienced manager, unable to gain a more 
experienced colleague’s advice on a decision-making matter, would be greatly 
assisted by access to records of a similar decision someone else in the agency 
may have made in the past, particularly where other related information is also 
readily available. Information Technology (IT)-based expert systems may also 
address this problem to some extent. Although this technology is still in its 
infancy, such systems are being introduced into agencies such as Centrelink, 
Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. This is a 
subject I will come to later.</FONT><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4></FONT><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Apart from mitigating the 
loss of corporate knowledge, record-keeping can assist the internal functioning 
of agencies by improving performance. Records of performance information are 
important in allowing an agency to monitor its performance and benchmark itself 
against other organisations, to ensure that performance is at optimum level. As 
well, fraud is less likely in a sound record-keeping environment that supports 
timely and accurate recording of data, with sufficient separation of duties. We 
are all aware that there is a cost associated with good record-keeping. In the 
main, it is a risk management judgement that should be made on the basis of a 
systematic risk assessment with sound identification and prioritisation of both 
internal and external risks. This involves careful examination of what outcomes 
are really being required and, therefore, what record-keeping practices are 
necessary to achieve those outcomes. Any approach should also meet legislative 
requirements for record-keeping. In short, records should be fit for their 
purpose. This is particularly important in any outsourcing situation where such 
records are being wholly or partially maintained by the private 
sector.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>It is apparent that 
there is an increasing tendency for policy and administrative decisions to be 
communicated and confirmed through e-mail communications. E-mail, electronic 
files and e-commerce are replacing traditional paper based records and 
transactions. This is a function of our changing expectations about the speed of 
communications, a growing emphasis on timely management of the ‘political’ 
dimensions of policy, and the appropriation by the public sector of a 
‘commercial paradigm’ in which ‘deals are done’ (which is given added impetus by 
the involvement of private sector ‘partners’ in various aspects of government 
operations). Nevertheless, as better practice private sector firms demonstrate, 
good record-keeping is an integral part of a sound control environment and 
subject to a regularly reviewed risk management strategy which is integral to 
their required outcomes and accountability requirements.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>As a particular instance of the task facing those 
of us who are required to oversight public sector operations and to provide 
important public accountability assurance, I note that the increasing use of 
e-mail poses significant challenges in terms of our traditional evidentiary 
standards (which customarily hinge on paper-based records) and the skills base 
of our auditors. As auditors, we are already confronting situations in which 
traditional forms of documentary evidence are not available. In such situations 
we are having to make links in the chain of decision-making in organisations 
which no longer keep paper records, or having to discover audit trails in 
electronic records, desktop office systems or archival data tapes. As 
communications between government agencies and outsourced service providers 
become increasingly electronic, it gives added urgency to making sure that the 
standards of accountability expected for the performance of government functions 
are understood and complied with by the relevant private sector partners. 
Particularly where there are still the hurdles of access and confidentiality to 
be overcome, the outcome is problematic.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>Public policy has only begun to come to grips with 
the changing context. The time that policy makers need to process, structure and 
use knowledge so as to make informed decisions has become a scarce commodity, 
particularly as 24 hour media coverage of events around the world exerts 
unrelenting pressure to act, or perhaps react, quickly. Already we are 
witnessing what has been termed ‘instant politics’, where far-reaching decisions 
are often made on the first available information.</FONT><SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>53</FONT></SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman"> 
</FONT><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Taking a longer-term perspective, 
there is little doubt that technological change will radically transform the 
framework conditions within which policy is made. Nevertheless, as the OECD 
Public Management Service has observed, rapid policy change, higher standards of 
accountability and short deadlines are unavoidable governance facts. As well, it 
might be possible to raise awareness of the independency of policy and 
implementation issues when it comes to e-government</FONT><SUP><FONT

record-keeping policies, systems, and processes in terms of good business

professional record-keeping principles. The audit found that, of the four 
agencies examined, most had just started to systematically assess their 
record-keeping needs and none had fully satisfied the criteria under the model

systematic assessment of its business needs and that of its stakeholders for 
records, and a risk based analysis of the likelihood and consequences relating 
to meeting those needs. The Commonwealth has introduced a manual to guide the

<UL></UL><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>An important element of any 
decision-making process is having ready, user-friendly access by managers and

base their decisions. It is of fundamental importance that the information used 
by managers in decision-making processes is relevant and reliable and available

that the probability of making poor decisions will considerably increase. 
Irrespective of the frameworks and processes installed by an agency, if the 
information upon which those decisions are based is flawed, the whole 
decision-making process will be undermined. Clearly, this is an unacceptable 
situation. Yet how many of us actually know whether we have the ‘right’ and/or 
‘sufficient’ information? The problem is accentuated with, say, the departure of 
a considerable body of corporate knowledge, when there is even more dependence 
on our information systems. This is another element of risk management that 
requires attention in a period of high staff turn-over and/or outsourcing of 
agency activities, including service delivery.</FONT> 
<UL></UL><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>When an organisation collects 
information to be used by management in making decisions it is imperative that 
the information concerned has some relevance to the people who use it. Relevant 
information can dramatically influence the time taken to make informed decisions 
as well as obviously improving decision-making. This applies to information both 
from our internal and external environments, with the latter often requiring 
particular attention by management to ensure its relevance and 
availability.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>The past decade 
has seen a radical transformation take place in the role of Information 
Technology (IT) in organisations worldwide. Technology has given us the ability 
to store and access enormous amounts of information and provides us the means to 
extract efficiently useful information for decision-making, particularly from 
the Internet. It is interesting to note that twenty years ago it would not have 
been possible to subject agencies to the level of scrutiny that we do today. 
With extra processing power comes the increased burden of expectation, as agency 
stakeholders now routinely require detailed information. The emphasis has 
increasingly been on sharing and collaboration.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>The capabilities of modern technology, both in 
communications and computing, also broaden the horizons for the amount of 
information agencies can capture. Utilising tools, such as the Internet, has 
opened up an enormous pool of information from which agencies can draw and 
benefit. However, this increased ability to capture and store information in 
itself has created questions about the ability of organisations to sift, 
disseminate, interpret and use the information currently available. In 
particular:</FONT><BR>

agencies throughout the APS collect vast quantities information that can be used 
for decision-making processes. The amount of information collected by agencies 
such as the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office 
each year as part of their day-to-day activities is increasing at an exponential 
rate. Although the advent of sophisticated data storage and interrogation 
technology during recent years has made it easier, and cheaper, for managers to 
access the information necessary to make decisions, this technology has also 
significantly increased the amount of information which can be stored by 
agencies. This, in turn, has led to its own problems of information selection, 
‘weeding’, disposal and archiving, particularly in collaborative or partnership 
arrangements. Appropriate training and skills development are essential elements 
of the changing culture associated with our greater dependence on information 
technology and new ways of working.</FONT><BR><BR><B><U><FONT

Australia may have met its goal to have all appropriate federal services online

</FONT><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4></FONT><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>This highlights one of the fundamental challenges 
in delivering government services, many of which are underpinned by complex 
policy and associated legislation. The challenge is that of enabling agency 
staff and their clients to understand and apply the legislation accurately in 
order to determine citizens’ benefits, entitlements and obligations fairly and 
consistently. A further dimension to this challenge is for agencies to manage 
the impact of legislative change, as existing programs are refined and more 
closely targeted over time and new programs are introduced.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>The accuracy and consistency of primary decision 
making by agencies, and their clients in a self-assessment environment, is the 
key issue to be addressed where complex policy is concerned. For example, in the 
social welfare domain, overpayment of benefits is at least as bad as, and 
possibly worse in some cases, than underpayment in terms of the impact on the 
client. In other domains, for example veterans’ and workers’ compensation, 
incorrect decisions can, if undetected, result in an enormous additional 
lifetime cost to government. The opportunity cost of incorrect decisions can 
also be significant where tax offsets are concerned. Claims by non-eligible 
people for tax offsets mean that potential revenue is 
foregone.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>It has also been 
observed that e-government success hinges on changing how agencies work and deal 
with the legislation which they are responsible for administering, as well as on 
how agencies interact with the public. For example, in the United States, the 
Internal Revenue Service has explicitly stated that its electronic tax 
administration mission is </FONT><I><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>to 
revolutionise how taxpayers transact and communicate with the 
IRS.</FONT></I><SUP><FONT face="Times New Roman">73</FONT></SUP><FONT 
face="Times New Roman"> </FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>Notwithstanding the complexity of the policy and legislative environment 
and the demands for easier, cheaper and more personalised service, agencies are 
still accountable to the Parliament for their management of public funds. With 
the more widespread application of technology, service delivery networks are 
fast evolving to cover multiple channels. Agencies also need to ensure that 
their decision-making on entitlements, benefits and obligations, is accurate, 
consistent and transparent, irrespective of the channel chosen by their 
customers. There is, consequently, a corresponding requirement for agencies to 
use technology to support the decision-making processes associated with complex 
policy and legislation.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>In the 
face of continued budgetary pressures and the expectation to continually improve 
service levels, it is even more important that Australian public sector agencies 
continue to explore the potential benefits of such technology in implementing 
their electronic service delivery strategies. </FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>Expert systems were one form of information 
technology-based decision-making tool which emerged during the 1980s. Expert 
systems use artificial intelligence technology and are encoded with human 
knowledge and experience to achieve expert levels of problem solving. This kind 
of technology presented some fundamental difficulties, particularly for 
government agencies, in adequately capturing and addressing the particular 
complexities presented by legislative rules. As a result, some of the early 
experiences with this sort of technology in the public sector were less than 
positive.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>More recently, a 
number of larger Commonwealth agencies have deployed legislative rulebase 
technology systems to administer complex legislation. These systems support the 
administration of determinative legislation, regulations and policy rules to 
improve the accuracy, consistency and timeliness of decisions. Time does not 
permit a detailed treatment here. However, the following three examples of the

ensure that all relevant agencies are ‘singing off the same song sheet’. 
</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Legislative rulebase 
technology offers a robust, electronic model of legislation which can be used to 
ensure an accurate, consistent and shared understanding of how the particular 
rules apply to particular kinds of customers. This offers a range of 
possibilities in cross-agency policy analysis, in order to, for example, better 
determine the interaction between the taxation and social welfare systems with 
regard to particular kinds of clients or customers. This kind of understanding 
is vital if real joined up government is to be achieved.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>While improvements in information collection, 
maintenance and access technology will help to address the knowledge management 
issue to some extent, where legislation and other complex policy rules are 
concerned, rulebase systems have the potential to greatly reduce the reliance on 
retained staff knowledge. Nonetheless, I do not think there will be a total 
substitute for the perception and judgement of key people particularly for those 
decisions outside the narrow rule-based regime of the assessor. As a developer 
of an Australian legislative rulebase technology states:</FONT><BR>

face="Times New (W" size=5>V. Concluding Remarks</FONT></B><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>Many of our performance audits have recommended a 
more systematic approach to decision-making in agencies, notably where they have 
been subject to considerable changes in their structures, systems and the ways 
in which they undertake their functions and/or deliver their services. This is a 
reflection of the need to manage effectively a more risky environment, perhaps 
where the requisite skills and experience need to be improved, such as in 
contract management. As well, managers have been encouraged to take a risk 
management approach to their responsibilities to improve performance, as part of 
the public service reforms, which now focus </FONT><U><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>more</FONT></U><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4> on achieving program outcomes efficiently and effectively.</FONT> 
<UL></UL><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>I am aware of the practical 
difficulties associated with applying effective decision-making strategies and 
processes to particular problems, including at different levels of the agency, 
and to fostering a successful decision-making environment. In particular, I am 
very aware of the human element in effective decision-making. But it is 
axiomatic that an agency with a clear and strong client orientation and robust 
decision-making processes should deliver quality client service, as such 
decisions are likely to be more timely, consistent and appropriate to the 
purpose. Although this concept sounds simple enough, it is often difficult for 
APS agencies to put into practice because of the complex and often disparate 
requirements of clients (who are also citizens) and other stakeholders such as 
the Government and the relevant Ministers. It is particularly important to 
ensure that agencies have a very good understanding and appreciation of such 
requirements as a responsive and responsible public service.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>At the end of the day we will all be held 
accountable for our decisions. That includes </FONT><U><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>how</FONT></U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4> 
they are made as well as </FONT><U><FONT face="Times New Roman" 
size=4>what</FONT></U><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4> outcomes are 
achieved. This does not happen by accident. It is greatly helped by a systematic 
approach to decision-making that builds in the necessary management elements to 
cope with the range of risks involved, including regular monitoring and review. 
Often the latter will depend on the availability of timely and relevant 
information supported by sound record-keeping practices. Our focus has to be on 
both our internal and external environments while making best use of 
increasingly lower cost systems based on electronic technology with their 
attendant risks, not the least of which are in delivering quality (usefulness 
for purpose) and not just quantity of information. Particular attention has to 
be given to our various management systems to ensure that they provide required 
information in a timely and useful manner to managers at all 
levels.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=4>Accountability will 
demand that we are always in a position to explain the basis of our decisions if 
requested. That accountability extends to ensuring we have taken effective 
action where the factors bearing on those decisions have changed or where we 
have simply made an error of judgment. Accountability means being under 
scrutiny. It is endemic to our democratic system. That is one of the challenges 
of working in the public sector, including that we take decisions which can be 
shown to be effective and help to achieve the outputs and outcomes required of 
us as a highly performing public service.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=4>Finally, I am sure that it would be generally 
agreed that a pro-active and anticipative public service would be seeking to 
provide suitable advice to Ministers for decision-making. It is important for a 
professional public service to contribute to the environment in which it 
operates. This is particularly important in a situation of devolved central 
authority where there are not the same ‘corporate’ information flows and support 
as in the past, which could create gaps in strategic knowledge, management 
approaches and accountability if no consideration is given to dealing with any 
such consequences by other means. The situation demands pro-active, not 
reactive, management attention which cannot simply be assumed will occur. This 
is a challenge for all of us, as we are all subject to external scrutiny in some 
form or another, not least by the Australian public whom we aim to 
serve.</FONT><BR><BR><B><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=5>NOTES AND
